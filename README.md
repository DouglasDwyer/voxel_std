# voxel_std

This repository contains a set of standard mods for the [Octo voxel game engine](https://github.com/DouglasDwyer/octo-release). These ship builtin with the engine, and can also act as building blocks for other mods. The root crate of this repository (`voxel_std`) can also be built as a library, which includes the binary data for every standard mod.

### Standard mods

- [`player_controller`](/player_controller/) - a very basic first-person camera controller
